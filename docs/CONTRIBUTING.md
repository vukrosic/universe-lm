1. Pick a topic / task from [issues](https://github.com/Open-Superintelligence-Lab/5-dollar-llm/issues) (issues are general name for tasks), carefully read it and understand it
2. Fork the repo
3. Clone it and implement the experiment, follow README
4. Once finished, report it back on Discord / Issue, we may merge your full code or just final results, depending on the task

| Type | Val Loss | Val Acc | Perplexity |
|----------|---------|------------|------------|
| Without QK Norm (Baseline) | 3.7395 | 34.97% | 42.08 |
| With QK Norm (New) | 3.6539 ✓ | 35.83% ✓ | 38.63 ✓ |

## Zero-compute expert

[Experiment](https://github.com/Open-Superintelligence-Lab/5-dollar-llm/pull/16) <br>
[@RohanKhanBD](https://github.com/RohanKhanBD) <br>
Small scale experiments didn't show zero-compute expert benefits the LLM. We might try this again with large scale Mixture of Experts.

## Token Smearing

[Experiment](https://github.com/Open-Superintelligence-Lab/5-dollar-llm/pull/19) <br>
[Shehab Ashraf](https://github.com/shehab-ashraf) <br>
Token smearing directly mixes a small, learnable fraction of the previous token’s embedding into the current token so local context is handled cheaply, reducing the burden on attention for short-range dependencies.
- Currently not enough compute to experiment more extensively.
