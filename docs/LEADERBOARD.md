## 🤝 Compute Sponsorship & Verification
**Don't have a 4090? We've got you.**

1.  **Verification**: If you optimize the code but can't verify the exact time, submit a Pull Request. We will run your code on our standardized hardware to confirm the record!
2.  **Sponsorship**: If you have a great idea (e.g., a new architecture) but no GPU, open an Issue/Ticket. If the idea looks promising, we will run the experiment for you and credit you.
