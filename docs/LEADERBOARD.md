# 🏆 Blueberry-Nano Speedrun Leaderboard

> Training is run on 1x4090 RTX.

Usually we will do research together to be able to beat records, but you may also do it alone.

## 📜 Official Rules

To qualify for the **Speedrun** (4.5 loss / 3.5 loss / 1B tokens) leaderboard, your run must follow these rules:

1.  Surpass the record (training loss of **≤ 4.5**, training loss of **≤ 3.5**, or fastest training time on **8M tokens** / **1B tokens**).
2.  Use the data mentioned in the [SETUP_INTRUCTIONS](docs/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
3.  The official metric is **Active Training Time**. Setup and compilation overhead (`Setup & Compilation Time`) is excluded.
4.  Measure your baseline (current code on your hardware) and compare your improvements against that baseline. Explain it to the PR description concisely.
5.  Keep the added code minimal, clean and readable.

> **Record Repeatability / Noise**:
- Run 1: 1m 27s 856ms, Train Loss: 4.7333, Val Loss: 4.8366
- Run 2: 1m 28s 275ms, Train Loss: 4.7397, Val Loss: 4.8373

⚠️ If you are unable to reproduce our results on RTX 4090, you may have different CPU, PCIe Bandwidth, or Thermal Throttling. We always recommend measuring your baseline first then comparing against your changes. We measure on Novita AI 4090 with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8473C CPU. The CPU selection is random so it requires multiple tries.
