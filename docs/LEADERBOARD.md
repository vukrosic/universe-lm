# 🏆 Blueberry-Nano Speedrun Leaderboard

> Training is run on 1x4090 RTX.

Usually we will do research together to be able to beat records, but you may also do it alone.

## 📜 Official Rules

To qualify for the **Speedrun** (4.5 loss / 3.5 loss / 1B tokens) leaderboard, your run must follow these rules:

1.  Surpass the record (training loss of **≤ 4.5**, training loss of **≤ 3.5**, or fastest training time on **8M tokens** / **1B tokens**).
2.  Use the data mentioned in the [SETUP_INTRUCTIONS](docs/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
3.  The official metric is **Active Training Time**. Setup and compilation overhead (`Setup & Compilation Time`) is excluded.
4.  Keep the added code minimal, clean and readable.

## ⚡ 8M Tokens Speedrun

> **Record Repeatability / Noise**:
-   Run 1: 1m 29s 209ms, 489 steps, Train Loss: 4.7479, Val Loss: 4.8467
-   Run 2: 1m 29s 613ms, 489 steps, Train Loss: 4.7501, Val Loss: 4.8580
-   Run 3: 1m 29s 759ms, 489 steps, Train Loss: 4.7405, Val Loss: 4.8448

⚠️ If you are unable to reproduce our results on RTX 4090, you may have different CPU, PCIe Bandwidth, or Thermal Throttling. We always recommend measuring your baseline first then comparing against your changes. We measure on Novita AI 4090 with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8473C CPU. The CPU selection is random so it requires multiple tries.

## 🤝 Compute Sponsorship & Verification
**You may rent 4090 affordably at**
[Salad](https://salad.com/pricing) | [Novita](https://novita.ai/pricing?gpu=1) | [VastAI](https://vast.ai/pricing) - A lot of GPU providers also give 50% off on spot billing.

You may also use free L4 at [LightningAI](https://lightning.ai/) - just make sure to measure your baseline as well and then compare. Once you break the record, we will measure it on 4090.

**Can't access a GPU? We've got you.**

1.  **Verification**: If you optimize the code but can't verify the exact time, submit a Pull Request. We will run your code on our 4090 to confirm the record!
2.  **Sponsorship**: If you have a great idea (e.g., a new architecture) but no GPU, open an Issue/Ticket. If the idea looks promising, we will run the experiment for you and credit you.
