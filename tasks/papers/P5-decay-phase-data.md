# P5 — Put the best data where the model can still learn it

- The warning: How Learning Rate Decay Wastes Your Best Data — https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18903 (preprint)

**Plain:** labs save their best math/code data for the end of training. But by then the learning
rate is tiny, so the model can barely absorb it. Schedule the data and the learning rate *together*.

**Implement:** two-stage data loader (stable-phase mix → decay-phase mix with math/code
concentrated), with the decay fraction exposed as a flag.

**Runs:** 3 at 52M (`Ladder52M1042MConfig`) — uniform mix / decay-concentrated / decay-concentrated + longer decay.

**Accept:** does concentration beat uniform beyond run-to-run noise on shared held-out
bits-per-byte? Config diffs + curves + figure, PR. Stretch (own task, only if this wins):
AC-ODM's online reweighting.
