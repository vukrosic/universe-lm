# Idea queue (index)

**Each idea lives in its own folder under `autoresearch/ideas/<NNN-slug>/idea.md`.**
This file is just the index / status board / active-slot tracker. To add a
new idea: create a folder, write `idea.md`, append to the table below.

**Pipeline:** the review→revise→implement→run loop and the canonical `status`
vocabulary are defined in [`PIPELINE.md`](PIPELINE.md). The routing
truth is the `status:` frontmatter in each `idea.md`; the tables here are a
human-readable view of it. Regenerate with
`grep -H "status:" autoresearch/ideas/*/idea.md`.

## Active remote queue (FIFO, always 3)

Tracks which folder occupies which **GPU slot** — remote execution, *not* the
pipeline `status` field. "Run state" below = idle/in-progress/done on the metal.
Owned by the **runner** (`prompts/runner.md`): it fills/updates these rows as it
launches and pulls. Raw results land in `remote-results/<date>-vast-<tier>/`.

| Slot | Folder | Run | Run state |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `011-cautious-lion/` | tiny1m3m + cautious-lion, s42 | DONE (**WIN**) 12:37Z, see evidence.md |
| 2 | empty | — | — (box idle, waiting on 015 code-impl) |
| 3 | empty | — | — |

> 006-schedule-free-adamw finalized 2026-06-09T12:01Z — NULL (trt 6.8056 vs ctrls
> 6.5953/6.6091, +0.21 worse). 010-polyloss finalized 2026-06-09T12:11Z — NULL
> (trt 6.5938 vs ctrls 6.5991/6.6050, inside variance). ⚠️ both batches: session
> ctrl drifted +0.19 vs prior days — within-session A/B valid, cross-day not (see
> evidence.md / closed.md; suspected baseline pollution from wholesale file sync).

> 2026-06-09 ~06:27-06:44Z batch ran ctrl+001+003+004+005+009+ctrl2 on
> vast-34386 (RTX 3060). 003-orphan FAIL; 001/004/005 NULL; **009 WIN** (largest
> of the day). All 4 are now `done`. **Pipeline is empty of `needs-run`
> candidates** — 010 (needs-review), 006 (planning), 003 (recoding) are mid-loop.
> Trigger the relevant agents to push them through; the runner will pick them
> up once they hit `needs-run`.

> ## 🔴 THE GPU MUST NEVER BE IDLE
> Hard invariant, not an aspiration. Keep **≥3 ideas at `needs-run`/`running`** so
> the remote always has work the moment a slot frees. An idle box = wasted rented
> compute = an **incident**: find the upstream stage starving the queue (taste →
> definition → code → mining) and drain it immediately. If all slots are empty and
> nothing is `needs-run`, the upstream agents are behind — launch them *now*, don't
> wait for a human to notice. See the prime directive in [`PIPELINE.md`](PIPELINE.md).

## Ideas board (in folder-number order)

Pure index — **no status column on purpose.** The `status:` frontmatter in each
`idea.md` is the *only* source of truth (see [`PIPELINE.md`](PIPELINE.md)). To
see live status: `grep -H "status:" autoresearch/ideas/*/idea.md`. Never copy
status into this file — that is exactly the drift that breaks the loop.

## PENDING — not yet foldered (migrate on first touch)

These are tracked here as a quick-lookup; copy to a numbered folder when
the idea is about to be run. Full spec lives in the table at the end of
this file until then.

Optimizer: Decoupled Q/K from V in Muon routing · Schedule-free AdamW · EMA-of-orthogonalized-matrix · AdEMAMix dual-EMA AdamW (018).
Architecture: Soft MoE (fallback) · BigBird sparse · Product-key FFN.
Loss/objective: Sigmoid loss / ET loss · PolyLoss.
Positional: FIRE · CoPE.
Attention stability: Forgetting Transformer per-head decay (020).
Normalization: Dynamic Tanh / DyT (019).

## CLOSED ideas (do not re-propose)

Moved to [`closed.md`](closed.md) — the loop's dedup list (miner reads it,
reviewer appends on `reject`). `LEADERBOARD.md` remains the full human results
record.

## Protocol (per-idea folder)

When an idea moves to implementation, add these files alongside `idea.md`:

| File | When | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `plan.md` | promoting to implementation | implementation spec, flags, controls, expected cost |
| `review.md` | parallel-AI code review | critique, suggestions, sign-off |
| `evidence.md` | after a run | val loss, commit link, Δ vs ctrl, verdict |
| `notes.md` | anytime | scratchpad, dead-ends, follow-up ideas |

To re-prioritize the queue: renumber folders. To close: set the `idea.md`
frontmatter `status` to `rejected` (killed in review) or leave at `done` (ran),
move a `rejected` folder to `autoresearch/ideas/_closed/`, and append a line to the
CLOSED section below. See [`PIPELINE.md`](PIPELINE.md) for the full
state machine.
